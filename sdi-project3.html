<p> I would like to share with you a story about my boyfriend, sister and I preparing for our flight to the beach.  We go through the process of packing our suitcases, and checking to see if we have everything. Once we have finished packing we happily declare that we are ready to fly.  We purchase our airline tickets online, and in doing so we declare our name, age, gender and whether or not we are each adult passengers. Once we have verified our passenger ticket information, we excitedly being the  countdown to our flight.  Once we have arrived at the airport, we must have our luggage weighed to see if there will be any additional luggage fees for this trip. I always have extra luggage fees, but a girl can't do without all of her shoes.</p>
